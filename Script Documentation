JavaScript Script – Live Clock
This script adds a live digital clock to my resume website. It updates every second and shows the current time at the top of the page. It's a small feature but it makes the website feel more active and modern.

The script works by using JavaScript's Date object to get the current time, and setInterval to refresh it every second. It updates the content inside a <div> with the ID clock.

Code used:
javascript
function updateClock() {
  const now = new Date();
  const clock = document.getElementById("clock");
  clock.textContent = now.toLocaleTimeString();
}

setInterval(updateClock, 1000);
updateClock();

Why I used it:
It shows I understand basic JavaScript concepts like functions, timing, and DOM manipulation.

It adds a real-time element to my website.

It’s a simple way to improve the user experience.

How to use:
Add a <div id="clock"></div> to your HTML where you want the time to show.

Save the JavaScript code in a file called script.js.

Link it in your HTML like this:

html
<script src="script.js" defer></script>

This script is small but useful, and I wrote and tested it myself.
