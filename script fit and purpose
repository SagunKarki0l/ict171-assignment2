Script Fit and Purpose
The JavaScript clock script is directly related to the purpose of the site. It adds a dynamic element to my personal resume page by displaying the current time in real-time. This shows basic interactivity and helps demonstrate that I understand how to use JavaScript with HTML and CSS.

Why itâ€™s relevant:
It adds a professional touch to the resume header by showing the live time.

Shows I can work with scripts and connect them to front-end content.

It proves I can go beyond just static HTML and include basic logic.

This makes the script a useful and fitting feature for a personal IT student portfolio page.
